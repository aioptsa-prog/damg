Patch: 2025-10-20 HOTFIX — admin wrappers + provider pagination

Files to upload (ensure paths and case match exactly):
- admin/release_preflight.php
- admin/validate_post_deploy.php
- admin/cleanup_safe_reset.php
- admin/retention_purge.php
- admin/dashboard.php
- lib/providers.php

Purpose:
- Fix 404 "File not found" by deploying new admin wrapper endpoints.
- Ensure search providers paginate to the maximum (Google unlimited when exhaustive; Foursquare cursor pages; Radar paged) and do not stop while results continue.

Post-deploy checks:
1) Visit /admin/release_preflight.php → should print PRE-FLIGHT with details.
2) Visit /admin/validate_post_deploy.php → JSON with decision and counters.
3) Visit /admin/cleanup_safe_reset.php → JSON summary (logs written to storage/logs/cleanup.log).
4) Visit /admin/retention_purge.php?dry-run=1 → retention summary (dry_run true), no deletions.
