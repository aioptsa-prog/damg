# Attribution and Licensing

If OpenStreetMap data is used (names, boundaries, polygons), the data is made available under the Open Database License (ODbL). You must attribute OSM contributors.

For GASTAT/NDP/SPL datasets, check each dataset’s terms of use and include the correct citation and date of access in deployment notes and release metadata.

Operational notes:
- Keep a snapshot record in `docs/GEODATA_SOURCES.md` with URLs and timestamps for each import.
- If OSM-derived data is used in UI (e.g., region/city names), ensure product or docs include OSM attribution text.
