# TODO / FIXME / HACK Inventory (initial)

Collected notable items:
- docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md: Large CSV export via CLI (TODO)
- docs/RUNBOOK.md: Large >50k batch via CLI (TODO)
- admin/diagnostics/index.php: CSP intentionally omitted — track migration to nonce-based CSP
- worker/build_installer.ps1: Review installer prompts and defaults for production hardening (commented TODOs inline)

Next steps:
- Automate a grep-based report in tools/dev/list_todos.php and include line numbers for all TODO/FIXME tags
